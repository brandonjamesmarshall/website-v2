## I write about Bitcoin and lead social media at Trust Machines, a Bitcoin company that produces Leather wallet, Orange Domains, and more!

I first bought Bitcoin in 2014 after reading a blog citing it as the future of money. But after realizing I couldn't do anything with it, I sold it a short while later, and quickly forgot about it.

In early 2017, I was working at Microsoft at the time and one of my customers struck up a conversation with me about crypto, which prompted me to take a second look. I rode the crypto waves up during the 2017 peak, then down during the 2018 crash. 

During that time, I concluded that Bitcoin was the only crypto I wanted to pursue, and truly fell down the orange-pilled rabbit hole.

I've since ended up at Trust Machines, a Bitcoin company that is focused on building apps on Bitcoin and expanding Bitcoin's use cases.

It's been roughly 10 years since I had originally sold my Bitcoin. But now, a new Bitcoin economy is thriving!

This website, fully inscribed on Bitcoin, represents some of the recent developments on Bitcoin that have really excited me. Check out the blog to learn more about how it works!
