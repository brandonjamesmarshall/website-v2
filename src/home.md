## I write about Bitcoin and lead social at Trust Machines, a Bitcoin company that produces Leather wallet, Orange Domains, and more!

### About Me
I first bought Bitcoin in 2014 after hearing some buzz about it on the internet, only to sell it all a few months later. In early 2017, one of my customers struck up a conversation with me about Bitcoin, which prompted me to take a second look. After doing much more research this time around, I fell down the rabbit hole and have been a fan ever since.
